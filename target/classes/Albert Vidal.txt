"Fill youth with enthusiasm through special action! Convince young people's parents, trainers and company chiefs that a promising future is possible only through good vocational training".
- Francisco Albert-Vidal, IVTO President 1984-1992

It was his nephew, Juan Martinez Albert, and his friend, Jose Rubio, who asked for this nomination two years ago. 

Francisco Albert-Vidal was born in Pinoso in 1917 and worked in the city hall of the village of Petrer. Later, he was the Vocational Training General Secretary until 1977 as well as the founder of the International VET Competitions, now WorldSkills.

He died in Madrid, in 1993, and was buried in the village of Pinoso.

On 31 March 2015, the plenary session of the city hall of Pinoso approved, unanimously, his appointment as honorary citizen of the village, as recognition of his work in the field of vocational training for young people through the creation of important events like WorldSkills Competitions.

Words from Pepe Rubio (partner and friend): "Thanks for this recognition. Francisco Albert Vidal worked for universal values, for people and their education" 

Words from Juan Martinez (nephew): "I'm very excited, and I remember many family moments with him, especially together with my mother, the only sister of Francisco who is still alive. I want to transmit gratitude from my whole family.”
